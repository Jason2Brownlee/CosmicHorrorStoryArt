# Dracula's Guest

## Story Synopsis

"Dracula's Guest" follows the experiences of an unnamed Englishman who ventures out into the German countryside on Walpurgis Night, despite warnings from his hotelier and others. Ignoring their advice, he finds himself caught in a violent storm near a deserted village, where he discovers a tomb with the name 'Countess Dolingen of Gratz' inscribed on it, along with a mysterious warning. Seeking shelter, he encounters supernatural phenomena, including a phantom wolf that protects him from a potentially deadly encounter. Rescued by the Count's minions under mysterious orders, the Englishman later learns that his detour may have been orchestrated by Dracula himself, serving as a prelude to the main events of Bram Stoker's "Dracula". This story is often considered a deleted first chapter of the novel, providing insight into Dracula's reach and influence, and setting the stage for the horrors to come.

In the distance, the faint outlines of the German countryside and the deserted village are visible, enveloped in the storm's fury. The crucifix, detailed with intricate lines, hangs from the Englishman's hand, glowing faintly as if imbued with a mysterious light, providing a beacon of faith amidst the darkness. This image encapsulates the journey from curiosity to terror, the clash between the known and the unknown, and the thin veil between the natural and the supernatural, all under the shadow of Dracula's omnipresent influence, making it a powerful and evocative representation of the story's essence.
