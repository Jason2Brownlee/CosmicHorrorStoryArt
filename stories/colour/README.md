# The Colour Out of Space, H. P. Lovecraft

## Summary

"The Colour Out of Space" by H.P. Lovecraft narrates the chilling tale of a rural area near Arkham, Massachusetts, blighted by a mysterious force after a meteorite crashes into the farm of the Gardner family. The meteorite, containing an alien entity or force manifesting as a color beyond the visible spectrum, begins to subtly influence the land, plants, animals, and the Gardners themselves. Initially, it brings a perverse, otherworldly vitality to the farm's flora and fauna, but soon this influence turns malevolent, leading to grotesque mutations, insanity, and death. The story unfolds through the investigation of an unnamed surveyor from Boston, revealing the fate of the Gardners and the spreading blight, culminating in the land's abandonment. The entity, after consuming everything on the farm, eventually returns to the cosmos, leaving behind a desolate, poisoned landscape haunted by its unnatural color, an enduring testament to the unknowable horrors that lie beyond our understanding.

### The Well of Horror

The focal point of the alien entity's influence is the farm's well, now a source of unspeakable terror.
