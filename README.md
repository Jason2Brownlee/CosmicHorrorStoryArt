 # Cosmic Horror Story Art

Generative art for selected cosmic horror stories, as an excuse to play with Dalle v3 and ChatGPT v4.

This work builds upon prior projects [Bad, Bad, Bad, Good](https://badbadbadgood.substack.com/) and [Interviews With Technical Experts](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/TechnicalExperts).

## Stories

I tried to focus on short classic horror/cosmic horror stories that are in the public domain. The initial thought was to create an illustrated short story collection, and I still may.

Each story has its own page with story synopsis, summarized selected scenes, summary of illustration directions, and art generated for the selected scenes.

I tried to fiddle with the generated art only minimally (e.g. regenerate like this or like that). I am interested in a generally automated process.

Stories are listed in the chronological order of generation, hopefully showing an improvement in methods and results.

Thoughts and observations:

* Use an expert to select and describe scenes. When I did this manually, I selected too many and did not understand the scenes well enough to describe them effectively.
* Use separate roles for 1) scene selection and description, 2) illustration description, 3) illustration generation.
* Use terms to motivate the consistency of description across scenes and the generation of imagery across scenes.
* Use terms to encourage the illustrator to be specific about the details of the objects in the scene.
* Generated images rarely have all elements in the description, or have them correctly, yet the images often have the right tone and are interesting.
* The scene description must include as much detail as possible, including objects and their composition.
