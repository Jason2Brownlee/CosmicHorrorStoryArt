# Story Art

Generative art for selected scifi and horror stories, as an excuse to play with Dalle v3 and ChatGPT v4.

## Stories

I tried to focus on short classic horror/cosmic horror stories that are in the public domain. The initial thought was to create an illustrated short story collection, and I still may.

Each story has its own page with story synopsis, summarized selected scenes, summary of illustration directions, and art generated for the selected scenes.

I tried to fiddle with the generated art only minimally (e.g. regenerate like this or like that). I am interested in a generally automated process.

* [Dagon](stories/dagon/README.md), H. P. Lovecraft.
* [The Fall of the House of Usher](stories/usher/README.md), Edgar Allan Poe.
* [An Inhabitant of Carcosa](stories/carcosa/README.md), Ambrose Bierce.
* The Yellow Sign, Robert W. Chambers.


## Meta

* [Prompt Templates](stories/prompt_templates.md)

Thoughts and observations

* Consistency of objects across the generated images is an open problem.
* Need to encourage the illustrator to be more specific about the details of the objects in the scene.
